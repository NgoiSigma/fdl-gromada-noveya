                                    Additional Clause — FDL Invariant

This repository implements an architecture rooted in Formally‑Dialectical Logic (FDL), as developed in the NOVEYA project. Any derivative works or forks must:

1. Preserve the structural coherence of FDL components (compiler, semantic shield, fallback scrolls, logic heatmap, FDL benchmark).
2. Clearly credit “Andrey / NGOI Sigma / NOVEYA” as originators of the FDL‑based methodology.
3. Not claim proprietary ownership over the core logic of FDL itself — it remains freely usable under Apache 2.0 with this notice.

By using or distributing this software, you agree to maintain semantic integrity, cognitive balance, and dialectical transparency.
