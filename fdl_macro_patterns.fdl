# 🧩 FDL MACRO PATTERNS

This file contains reusable semantic logic blocks (macros) for constructing complex FDL flows. Each macro follows the canonical FDL block structure and can be imported or referenced in agents, decision trees, or resonant programs.

## 🔁 Macro: dialectic\_resolution

```fdl
@block "Macro::DialecticResolution"
init:
  intent: "resolve duality between opposing forces"

expand:
  define: A = proposition_1
  define: B = proposition_2

tension:
  contradiction: A ∧ ¬B → dual_state
  resolution: derive_c(A, B) → Synthesis_C

synthesize:
  output: resolved_thesis = Synthesis_C
```

---

## 🔁 Macro: ethical\_routing

```fdl
@block "Macro::EthicalRouting"
init:
  intent: "choose action path based on ethical weight"

expand:
  assess: action_set by impact_score, ethical_tag

tension:
  filter: remove actions with tag == "exploitative"

synthesize:
  select: top_ranked_action → execution_path
```

---

## 🔁 Macro: feedback\_loop\_sync

```fdl
@block "Macro::FeedbackLoopSync"
init:
  intent: "stabilize loop through resonance feedback"

expand:
  detect: deviation_signals from environment
  match: ideal_signal_pattern

tension:
  if deviation > threshold then apply_resonant_adjustment

synthesize:
  output: harmonic_state ← loop_update()
```

## 🔗 USAGE

* Import via compiler into FDL programs
* Adaptable to any logic structure or AI-agent
* Semantically tagged for graph engines

> Macros are **resonant shapes** — they live within the field and bring rhythm to logic.
