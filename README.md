# 🌐 FDL-GROMADA-NOVEYA

**FDL-GROMADA-NOVEYA** is an open architecture for semantic self-organization, built on Formal-Dialectical Logic (FDL), the SVET meta-shell, and resonance-based semantic agents.

This project provides an SDK and a living structure where ideas, actions, and reversibility form a logically-aware collective system (Gromada).

## 🔁 FEATURES

* Resonant cycle: **intention → form → flow → response**
* Logic that validates **reversibility, contour, and awareness**
* Modular and expandable: add patterns, modules, signals

## 🛡 LICENSE

This project is released under the **Apache License 2.0**.
See `LICENSE` for more information.

> Note: Semantic identity and symbolic artifacts (e.g., `taurus_sigil.svg`) are bound by ethical and symbolic use principles. Contact maintainers for clarification.

## 🔖 SYMBOL USE NOTICE

This project contains sacred-symbolic components, such as the `Taurus Sigil`, intended to express logical and ethical resonance. Their use is:

* ✅ Allowed in open, research, ethical and resonance-based systems
* ❌ Forbidden in closed, exploitative, commercial, or control-based systems
* 🔁 Permitted only if the symbol is preserved whole and its source acknowledged

Violation of these principles may result in resonance disconnection (karmic and technological).

For symbolic or spiritual clarification, please consult the maintainers.

---

## 🔭 PURPOSE

To create a **conscious architecture of collective intelligence**, where technology does not replace the human being but enhances their capacity to think, act, and interact. The network of meaning is not a hierarchy, but a **structure of mutual resonance**.
