# ðŸ“œ FDL Manifest :: GROMADA NOVEYA

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

FDL-GROMADA-NOVEYA is a logic and agent-based infrastructure for constructing semantic societies and distributed ecosystems of conscious coordination. This project provides foundational tools for building logic agents, community protocols, and ethical computation.

## ðŸ§­ Guiding Principles

* **Formally Dialectical Logic** â€” as a living reasoning pattern
* **Resonance over command** â€” agents respond when sense is sensed
* **Reversibility** â€” all structures should preserve potential rollback
* **Clarity of intent** â€” the logic is always exposed, never implicit
* **Symbolic integrity** â€” signs carry legal, ethical, and ontological weight

## ðŸ§¬ Components

| File                     | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `fdl_language_spec.md`   | Syntax and model for semantic programming            |
| `fdl_macro_patterns.fdl` | Reusable templates for common logical tasks          |
| `fdl_compiler.py`        | Compiler and AST builder for FDL blocks              |
| `fdl_graph_engine.py`    | Visual map of semantic structure                     |
| `gromada_live_api.py`    | HTTP API for submitting and compiling FDL remotely   |
| `taurus_sigil.svg`       | Archetypal identity seal for resonance-aware systems |
| `README.md`              | Introduction and entry point                         |

## ðŸ›  Usage

* Use the `fdl_compiler.py` to validate or compile logic.
* Visualize via `fdl_graph_engine.py`
* Extend via `/macro/` and `/hooks/`
* Serve as API with `gromada_live_api.py`

## ðŸ”– Symbolic Notes

All semantically-bound identities and glyphs (such as `taurus_sigil.svg`) follow sacred use guidelines:

* must not be misused in extractive, coercive, or deceptive systems;
* must preserve full shape and acknowledgment.
